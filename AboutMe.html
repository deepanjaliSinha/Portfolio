							<p>I'm currently pursuing an integrated degree in Engineering and MBA at Mukesh Patel School 
								of Technology Management and Engineering, NMIMS University. I am also working as an Intern 
								Analyst at Shoppers Stop Limited, where my responsibilities focus on digital transformation 
								initiatives of the company. This involves integrating new, in-demand technologies and services 
								into retail operations to reduce time and manual efforts. Currently, I am working on data migration 
								and automation of daily, weekly, and monthly business processes, such as scheduled tasks and 
								analytical models.<br><br>

								With a technical background, I initially had interests in designing and development. However, 
								over the years of my education and internships, I have developed a keen interest in patterns, 
								graphs, visualization, and analytics. Being an avid reader and explorer, further enhances my 
								imaginative capacities, and constantly motivates me to deliver my best.
