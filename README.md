# portfolio
<p>Hello guys! This is my portfolio, all the projects that I have added are either part 
of my college assignment or my personal project.
Feel free to check it out.
For my portfolio I have used HTML5up <a href="https://html5up.net/forty">Forty</a> Template.
I have modified it a lot so that it suits my portfolio projects and view, 
but its a really good to start with.<br>
View my <a href="https://deepanjalisinha.github.io/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> here.</p>
